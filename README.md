### Project Title
My project for the Udacity course

### Description
It provides some useful data and stats on a company called bikeshare. This company rents bikes to people for trips to an other station or to the same station if the person  was looking for a ride. You can get the datasets from udacity. The datasets are for chicago, new_york_city, and washington.

### Credits
I used [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53037698/how-can-i-find-the-most-frequent-two-column-combination-in-a-dataframe-in-python) to get help to get an idea on how to find the most frequent combination of start station and end station

I also used the project template as well as some help from the practice solutions for project 3.
